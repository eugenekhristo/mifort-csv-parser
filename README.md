# CSV-PARSER (task) ðŸ”¥ 
This is a task implementation of CSV-parser. All stuff implemented with **TypeScript** in **Node.js** environment. As a DBMS was used **MySQL**.  Tests written in TypeScript too with **mocha**, **chai** and **nyc**. 

> _PS_ Currently project is in ALPHA stage of development and may work incorrectly.

## Usage
Just clone this repo locally. After run `npm i`. Put your `.csv` file into `src/` directory. After in `src/` there is `csv-config.ts` where you have to provide some info about your `.csv`'s file columns. Finally run **`npm start`** and follow instructions in your CLI.
